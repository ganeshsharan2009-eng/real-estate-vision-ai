# Real Estate Vision AI – Problem Statement

## What we’re solving
Real estate investors spend countless hours analyzing property data and satellite imagery to determine value or development potential. Our AI tool automates this process by analyzing images and predicting features such as land type, building density, or estimated value.

## Why it matters
- Saves time for investors and developers  
- Reduces bias in property assessment  
- Makes large-scale land analysis possible using AI

## Expected Impact
This project helps bridge AI and real estate by improving how we understand property characteristics through data and images.
